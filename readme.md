## Questions
- [ ] Are we allowed to write to a hidden file (e.g. ds_store): 
        Yes, you can write hidden files to the share.
- [ ] Is the status in the file explorer mandatory or just an example?
     Just an example. GUI part of the service will be implemented by netrics.
- [ ] How to distinguish files to watch from files to ignore:
You can make a proposition. My idea is, that we can configure the service with a regexp. File names matching the regexp will be watched.
- [ ] Runtime environment of the Netrix service (how do we access the fs)?
Login dates are described in the challenge document.
- [ ] Meet personally? No slack or phone, only email possible.
